## [Unreleased] - Started: 12-23-19

### Added
- `Phoenix`: `upsertUsersPermissions` and `upsertUsersSitemaps` utils for persisting user access directly to `dev`

### Changed
- `Phoenix`: user resources and sitemap management is now **single-user**- (CUD) and **single-team**- (UD) based, instead of operating on all users at once.
  1) guards against transaction failure when writes exceed 16MB 
  2) improves UX (involves less steps) for `Polaris` users to update permissions/sitemaps
  3) makes it faster to update permissions/sitemaps (now that writes are smaller).

### Removed
- `Phoenix`: `push to dev` button has been commented out, until there's a discussion on managing admin features.
