  * * PLAN OF ATTACK * *

  STEP 1:
    Join all the latest month/year/project payer data together.
    That means: 1. qoa 2. access scores 3. policy links 4. additional criteria.
    That'll get us `combinedPayerData`, which we'll write to pulse-dev and also
    pass onto the next step.

  STEP 2:
    For every `treatmentPlan` in `combinedPayerData`
    (`treatmentPlan` is combination of indication, population, line,
    regimen, book, coverage), work in the DRG and MMIT state lives data so
    we can get a result that's the breakdown of payers and their lives by access
    category for every state for every `treatmentPlan`. We write that result to
    pulse-dev as well.
